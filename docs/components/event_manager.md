## Introduction

EventManager Component allows you to easily manage events throughout your
application.

## Usage

Accessing `EventManager` can be done in two ways. The preferable way using
`EventManagerTrait`, but you can also access it directly, using
`EventManager::getInstance()`. Let's see a simple example of subscribing to an event
called 'some.evet' with an instance of `YourHandler`:

```php
class YourClass
{
    use EventManagerTrait;

    public function index()
    {
        $this->eventManager()->listen('some.event')->handler(new YourHandler());
    }
}
```
You're done! You have just subscribed to an event and the moment 'some.event' is fired,
your handler will process it.

## Event Handlers

Now let's take a look at YourHandler. An event handler can be any class. `EventManager`
will call `handle(Event $event)` method on your handler object, by default. You can,
however, specify a method you want EventManager to call:

```php
class YourHandler
{
    public function customHandle(Event $event)
    {
        // Do something with the $event...
    }
}

// Using your custom method
$this->eventManager()->listen('some.event')->handler(new YourHandler())->method('customHandle');

//Besides using classes, you can also respond to an event using a callable:
//Using callable as event handler
$handler = function(Event $event){
    // Do something with the $event...
};

$this->eventManager()->listen('some.event')->handler($handler);
```

## Firing events

To fire a simple event use the following code:

```php
$this->eventManager()->fire('some.event');
```

You can also pass some data when firing an event, which will be passed to every event
listener:

```php
$data = [
    'some' => 'data',
    'ip' => '192.168.1.10'
];

$this->eventManager()->fire('some.event', $data);
```

Any given data that is not an Event object, will be converted to generic Event object and
your data will be accessible either by using array keys, or as object properties:

```php
class YourHandler
{
    public function customHandle(Event $event) {
        // Access your data
        echo $event->some; // 'data'
        echo $event['some'] // 'data'
    }
}
```

If you want to use custom Event data types, refer to section custom event classes

## Firing events using a wildcard

You can also use wildcard to fire multiple events at once. The following code will fire all
events starting with event. and pass $data to each one of them:
```php
$this->eventManager()->fire('event.*', $data);
```

## Execution priority

`EventManager` allows you to specify an execution priority using `priority()` method. Here's
an example:

```php
// Specify a priority of execution for your event listeners
$this->eventManager()->listen('some.event')->handler(new YourHandler);
```

## Custom event classes

When firing events, you can also pass your own event classes, that extend generic Event
class. For example, you want to fire an event called `cms.page_saved` and pass the Page
object. Of course, you could simply pass an array like `['page' => $pageObject]`, but for the
sake of the example, let's pretend it's more complicated than that:

```php
// Create your `PageEvent` class
class PageEvent extends Event
{
    private $_page;
    
    public function __construct(Page $page)
    {
        // Call constructor of parent Event class
        parent::__construct();

        // Set your page object
        $this->_page = $page;
    }

    public function getPage()
    {
        return $this->_page;
    }
}

// Fire an event
$pageEvent = new PageEvent($pageObject);
$this->eventManager()->fire('cms.page_saved', $pageEvent);

// In your handler, you can now access page object using $event->getPage()
class YourHandler
{
    public function customHandle(PageEvent $event)
    {
        $pageObject = $event->getPage();
    }
}
```

This is a simple example, but it shows the power of creating your own Event classes and
add as much functionality to your events as you need.

## Event subscriber

Another cool feature of the EventManager is the ability to subscribe to multiple events at
once. You will need to create a subscriber class implementing EventSubscriberInterface:

```php
class PageEventSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    use EventManagerTrait;
    
    /**
    * Handle page creation event
    */
    public function onPageCreated($event)
    {
        //
    }
    
    /**
     * Handle page update
     */
     public function onPageUpdated($event)
     {
        //
     }

     /**
     * Register the listeners for the subscriber.
     */
     public function subscribe()
     {
        $this->eventManager()->listen('cms.page_created')->handler($this)->method('onPageCreated');
        $this->eventManager()->listen('cms.page_updated')->handler($this)->method('onPageUpdated');
     }
}

// Subscriber to multiple events using your new subscriber class
$this->eventManager()->subscribe($subscriber);
```

There are situations when you need to temporarily disable EventManager. For example,
deleting a huge portion of files that are not directly related to the application (local cache
files) does not require firing all of related events. In this case use the following methods:

```php
// Disabling EventManager
$this->eventManager()->disable();
// Do some work that would fire loads of unnecessary events...
// Enabling EventManager
$this->eventManager()->enable();
```
