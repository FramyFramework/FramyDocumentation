# Controller
##  Introduction

Instead of defining all of your request handling logic as Closures in route files, you may
wish to organize this behaviour using Controller classes. Controllers can group related
request handling logic into a single class. Controllers are stored in the
`app/custom/Http/Controller` directory.
